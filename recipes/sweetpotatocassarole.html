                <h2>Description</h2>

                    <p>Sweet potato casserole is a comforting, classic dish that's often enjoyed during holiday meals. To prepare it, sweet potatoes are peeled, 
                    boiled, and mashed until smooth. The mashed sweet potatoes are then mixed with ingredients like butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla to 
                    enhance their natural sweetness, along with a touch of milk or cream to make the mixture creamy. Once combined, the sweet potato mixture is spread 
                    into a baking dish, forming the base of the casserole.</p>
    
                    <p>The topping is what makes sweet potato casserole special. A layer of mini marshmallows and/or a pecan streusel adds texture and flavor. 
                    The pecan streusel is made by mixing chopped pecans with brown sugar, butter, and flour to create a crunchy, buttery topping. As the casserole 
                    bakes, the marshmallows become golden and gooey, while the pecan topping crisps up, offering a contrast to the soft, sweet filling. This dish 
                    strikes the perfect balance between sweet and savory, making it a favorite side dish for festive gatherings.</p>
