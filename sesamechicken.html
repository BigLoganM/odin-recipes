                <h2>Description</h2>

                    <p>Sesame chicken is a delicious, popular dish that combines tender, crispy chicken with a savory-sweet sesame sauce. To make it, you start by preparing bite-sized pieces of 
                    chicken, usually chicken breast or thighs, which are coated in a light batter made from flour, cornstarch, and egg. These pieces are then fried until golden and crispy, 
                    creating the perfect base for the flavorful sauce. While the chicken is frying, a mixture of soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil is whisked 
                    together to form a smooth, rich sauce.</p>

                    <p>Once the chicken is fried, it is tossed in the prepared sauce, allowing it to soak up the delicious flavors. Toasted sesame seeds are sprinkled over the coated chicken, 
                    adding a nutty crunch that enhances the dish's flavor profile. Itâ€™s often served over steamed rice with a side of vegetables like broccoli or bok choy to balance out the 
                    richness. The final dish offers a perfect harmony of sweetness from the honey, umami from the soy sauce, and a deep, earthy flavor from the sesame oil and seeds, making 
                    it a crowd-pleaser at any meal.</p>
